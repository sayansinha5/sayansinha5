# I'm Sayan — @sayansinha5 👋

I’m working as a Lead Software Engineer at [Wittypen](https://wittypen.com).

Most of the time I spend on reviewing PRs, fixing bugs, testing features and building something new. I enjoy when it comes to strategic planning and talking about challenges 💻

In meantime, not only participated but won many hackathons.
