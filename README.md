# Hello, I'm Sayan Sinha 👋

## About Me

I’m working as a Lead Software Engineer at Wittypen. Building the content platform of the future 💎.

I spent most of my time on my day job, review PRs, fixing bugs and building new features. I enjoy when it comes to strategic planning and talking about challenges 💻

In meantime, not only participated but won many hackathons.
